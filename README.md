### repo description

This repo contains the progression of an android application communication via MQTT with a micro:bit and Raspberry Pi. The android client is written in Java while the MQTT client hosted on the Raspberry PI is written in python. Through wifi connectivity, the android application will process step counts recorded on the micro:bit and use a tuned SGD model hosted on the Raspberry PI.
